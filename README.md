# An integrated approach for programming education in Finnish school


Codemodules is an environment where teachers can apply programming as a tool to teach subject matter (or domain) knowledge.

The toolset includes an integrated development and assesment environment and proposals for potential exercises.

## Demo

See [somewhat up-to-date demo](http://labs.humanisti.fixme.fi/codemodules/codemodules-editor/public_html/#/), unluckily only in Finnish.
